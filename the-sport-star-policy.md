### Evaluation criteria

Evaluating someone in a tech company is *not* like evaluating the performance of a sport star. Sport stars live a metric based existence where the rules are black and white. To be fair to all Partners, we evaluate them on 3 main "roles" - Business Owner, Team Leader, and High Performer. Each roles can be broken down into day-to-day practices.

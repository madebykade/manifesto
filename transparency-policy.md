## Internal transparency

Everyone who is part of the Kade Collective practices [Radical Condor](http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/).
This means that we are 100% transparent internally. Everything to do with strategy and personal performance is discussed openly.


## Public facing transparency

The following is public

- Salaries
- Profit
- Revenues
- Traffic
- General Practices


## What are the exceptions?

- Company valuations (this is because it may scare off investors. If their appetitie is public, then it could harm them when trying to close deals in the future)
- If a project does not directly belong to us, we will only expose information that already publicly available
- We will not expose any practices which give us a competitive advantage

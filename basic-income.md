This document describes how full time employees are compensated once they become part of the Kade Collective.


## The How

##### Compensation

- People who join Kade fulltime become "Partners"
- Partners are paid an unconditional basic monthly income - enough for them to live comfortably
- Kade pays 50% of its profit to partners every year in the form of bonuses. The remaining 50% is re-invested
- There are 4 tiers of partner, corresponding to their ability
    - Full Partner (weighting = 10)
    - Senior Partner (weighting = 7)
    - Junior Partner (weighting = 3)
    - Intern (weighting = 1)

In this model, if Kade has $840K profit, the bonus pool would be $420K. If there is one of each type of partner in Kade then the total pool weighting would be 21 (10 + 7 + 3 + 1). This means that each weighting "unit" is worth $20K ($420K / 21). The bonus at the end of the year would be:

- Full Partner: $200K (10 * $20K)
- Senior Partner: $140K (7 * $20K)
- Junior Partner: $60K (3 * $20K)
- Intern: $20K (1 * $20K)

There is an incentive to minimize the number of partners and maximize the profit. Partners are therefore commercially focused as well as operationally focused. There is also an incentive for Partners to live in locations that have a low cost of living.

##### Work: "80% time"

- Partners must spend one day a week (Wednesday) working on improving existing projects. They are always welcome to work on these projects on other days, but have no obligation to do so.
- On any other day Partners can work on any project they want and utilize the common assets (infrastructure, systems, etc)
- Partners have unlimited leave. They must follow the [Sport Star Policy](/manifesto/the-sport-star-policy/) (specifically, do what is best for the team).

#####  Non-partners

Kade still employs people as non-partners (usually outsourced) for menial tasks that don't directly contribute to the culture of collaboration. The type of work which is required to be performed in Kade is as important as the people who become partners. If they work doesn't directly contribute to an individual's growth, the company covers the cost. The message is simple: Partners help Kade grow, Kade helps Partners to grow.


## Challenges

- There will be friction arise around how soon a partner should be promoted
    - 360 / evaluations?
- Dealing with underperforming partners. Possible mitigations:
    - 360 / evaluations?
    - Long probation periods with constant feedback
- Partners who join could immediately be earning more than others who have been with the company a long time. Possible mitigations:
    - add a yearly multiplier / bonus?
- Outsourcing menial jobs is probably not efficient in the long term. Possible mitigations:
    - Get an internal operations team, but they should be managed separately to allow them to develop their own culture

### The Kade Collective manifesto

Our manifesto is an open declaration of how we intend to operate. It is as mutuable as any policy that is confronted with the real world. 

The manifesto is not designed to be universally applicable.
It is designed to see how a group of like minded people work together while learning a few things about organisational theory along the way. It is strongly shaped by our past experience and iteratively improved upon as we continue to work together.
